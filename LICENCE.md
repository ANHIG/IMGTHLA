We are strongly opposed to the mirroring of the data contained on our sites, both
hla.alleles.org and the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database, and would ask that rather than mirror
the information, appropriate links are provided where applicable.

permission first, please contact hla [at] alleles [dot] org for further details

 FUNDING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The development of the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database was funded by an EU BIOTECH grant. The
work of maintaining and updating the database has been supported in the past by
the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the National Institute of Health, the
National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and more recently by the Anthony Nolan
Trust. The continual maintenance and any further development of the database
relies on alternate sources of financial support, which are actively been sought
for the continued maintenance of the database. The Sequence.org initiative at
the NMDP has solicited funds from institutions and companies who produce HLA
typing reagents, typing systems, and instrumentation or that otherwise utilise
these databases in critical components of their business. To learn more about how
your business can support the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database, please contact:
Todd Peterson, (Email: todd [dot] peterson, [at] nmdp [dot] org), Be The Match
Foundation.

If you intend to use any of the data found on our sites for commercial use, we
would ask you to consider funding the database and the work we do. Without
continued funding the database cannot be maintained.

 DISCLAIMER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where discrepancies have arisen between reported sequences and those stored in
the database, the original authors have been contacted where possible, and
necessary amendments to published sequences have been incorporated. Future
sequencing may identify errors and the WHO Nomenclature Committee would welcome
any evidence that helps to maintain the accuracy of the database. We therefore
make no warranties regarding the correctness of the data, and disclaim liability
for damages resulting from its use. We cannot provide unrestricted permission
