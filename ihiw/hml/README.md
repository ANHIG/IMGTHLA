# Reference alleles for the 18th IHIWS

This directory contains selected reference sequences for the 18th International HLA and Immunogenetics Workshop. Further details are available from the IHIW Git Repository which can be found at:

* https://github.com/IHIW/bioinformatics

These reference sequences were selected using a set of python scripts, which choose the lowest-numbered full-length sequence available in a given IPD-IMGT/HLA release. For these purposes, "full length" refers to the 'genomic' sequences curated by the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database, which include sequence for all exons and introns, and the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). This reference allele catalog was assembled for use in generating and aligning consensus sequences, and describing novel sequence variation. The python scripts can be obtained from the IHIW repository.

## Loci

Reference alleles are provided for each HLA locus (HLA-A, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DRA, -DRB1, -DRB3, -DRB4 and -DRB5) Sequences are also provided for the MICA and MICB loci, as well as HLA-DMA, -DMB, -DOA, -DOB.

For each release starting with 3.26.0, this catalog is available in this folder in two files:

* A list of alleles, ordered by locus and allele name
* A fasta formatted file containing the reference sequence
