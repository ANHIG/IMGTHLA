We are strongly opposed to the mirroring of the data contained on our sites, both hla.alleles.org and the IMGT/HLA Database, and would ask that rather than mirror the information, provide appropriate links where applicable.

If you intend to distribute a modified version of our data, you must ask us for permission first, please contact IMGT/HLA Support for further details of how modified data can be reproduced.

Funding
The development of the IMGT/HLA Database was initially funded by an EU BIOTECH grant. The work of maintaining and updating the database has been supported in the past by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the National Institute of Health, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and more recently by the Anthony Nolan. The continual maintenance and any further development of the database relies on alternate sources of financial support, which are actively been sought for the continued maintenance of the database. The Sequence.org initiative at the NMDP has solicited funds from institutions and companies who produce HLA typing reagents, typing systems, and instrumentation or that otherwise utilise these databases in critical components of their business. To learn more about how your business can support the IMGT/HLA Database, please contact: Angie Dahl (Tel: +1 612 884 8670, Email: adahl@nmdp.org), Be The Match Foundation.

If you intend to use any of the data found on our sites for commercial use, we would ask you to consider funding the database and the work we do. Without continued funding the database cannot be maintained.

Disclaimer
Where discrepancies have arisen between reported sequences and those stored in the database, the original authors have been contacted where possible, and necessary amendments to published sequences have been incorporated. Future sequencing may identify errors and the WHO Nomenclature Committee would welcome any evidence that helps to maintain the accuracy of the database. We therefore make no warranties regarding the correctness of the data, and disclaim liability for damages resulting from its use. We cannot provide unrestricted permission regarding the use of the data, as some data may be covered by patents or other rights.
