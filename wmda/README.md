At the request of the IT Working Group of the World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA), we are making a number of computer readable files available. These files will document: the official WHO HLA Nomenclature, the relationships between serologically defined antigens and the relationships between HLA allele sequences and their serologically defined antigens. Updated versions of these files will be released every three months at the time new versions of the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database become available.

If you are regular user of these files and would like to be kept updated of any changes to the files, please email hla [at] alleles [dot] org and ask to be added to our WMDA mailing list.

Files for each individual release are located within appropriately named branch, for example files for Release 3.17.0 are located in the 3170 branch.
